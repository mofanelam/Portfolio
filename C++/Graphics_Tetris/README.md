# Tetris
The assignment was to write a graphics program using OpenGL and / or GLSL. The supporting pdf document serves as a user-manual for the program.

The task was to write a playable version of the classic Tetris game, including piece look-ahead, a scoring system and levels of difficulty.

There are 7 pieces, each with 4 squares / cubes. The player can move the pieces left and right as they fall, or rotate. When a complete line is made, it disappears and the fallen pieces below will move down by one row. The game ends if there is no where for room for the next piece to fall.

A pseudo-3D display was used to make it more attractive, the gameplay look as follow:
