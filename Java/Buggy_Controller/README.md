A physical buggy with one sonic sensor and two light sensors (Lejos) was given.
The task was to design a program that guides the robot to the top right corner.

Note: The goal is always the top right corner, assume that the robot always starts at A = 0,0.

The program has the following requirements:

1. Systematically explore the grid and create a full representation of which paths are blocked.
2. Provide a mechanism to store and view the map created by the robot.
3. Calculate the shortest unobstructed path to the way out, and write a message to send to the other robots.
